The deployment of green infrastructure is currently blocked due to a lack of complete guidance for enabling File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) in Microsoft Defender for Cloud via Terraform.

Issues:
    - Role Requirements Not Documented: Enabling FIM requires the identity to have either Log Analytics Workspace Owner or Security Administrator role â€” this is not covered in existing documentation.

    - Rules Configuration Unclear: There is no official documentation or schema guidance on how to properly define and apply FIM rules through Terraform.

Until both gaps are addressed, automated deployment of FIM via Terraform cannot be reliably implemented.
