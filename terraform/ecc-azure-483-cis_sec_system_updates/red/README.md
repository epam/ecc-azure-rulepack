We are unable to deploy the red state (non-compliant) for the rule.

There is no reliable way to simulate or provision a VM with outdated patches intentionally, as:
    - OS patch status is evaluated dynamically by Microsoft Defender for Cloud.
    - Terraform and Azure Policy do not support enforcing or simulating a non-compliant patch state.
    - Any "red" state would require artificially withholding critical updates, which is not safe or sustainable in CI environments.
